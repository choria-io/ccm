Overview The archive resource manages remote archives with three phases:
Download: Fetch archive from a URL to local filesystem Extract: Unpack archive contents to a target directory Cleanup: Optionally remove the archive file after extraction These phases are conditional based on current state and configuration.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://choria-cm.dev/design/archive/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>HTTP Provider</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/archive/http/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/archive/http/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the implementation details of the HTTP archive provider for downloading and extracting archives from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
Provider Selection The HTTP provider is selected when:
The URL scheme is http or https The archive file extension is supported (.tar.gz, .tgz, .tar, .zip) The required extraction tool (tar or unzip) is available in PATH The IsManageable() function checks these conditions and returns a priority of 1 if all are met.</description></item></channel></rss>
