Overview The service resource manages system services with two independent dimensions:
Running state: Whether the service is currently running or stopped Enabled state: Whether the service starts automatically at boot These are managed independently, allowing combinations like “running but disabled” or “stopped but enabled”.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://choria-cm.dev/design/service/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Systemd Provider</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/service/systemd/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/service/systemd/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the implementation details of the Systemd service provider for managing system services via systemctl.
Provider Selection The Systemd provider is selected when systemctl is found in the system PATH. The provider checks for the executable using util.ExecutableInPath("systemctl").
Availability Check:
Searches PATH for systemctl Returns priority 1 if found Returns unavailable if not found Concurrency A global service lock (model.ServiceGlobalLock) is held during all systemctl command executions to prevent concurrent systemd operations within the same process. This prevents race conditions when multiple service resources are managed simultaneously.</description></item></channel></rss>
