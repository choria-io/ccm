Overview The archive resource manages remote archives with three phases:
Download: Fetch archive from a URL to local filesystem Extract: Unpack archive contents to a target directory Cleanup: Optionally remove the archive file after extraction These phases are conditional based on current state and configuration.</description></item><item><title>Exec Type</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/exec/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/exec/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the design of the exec resource type for executing commands.
Overview The exec resource executes commands with idempotency controls:
Creates: Skip execution if a file exists Refresh Only: Only execute when triggered by a subscribed resource Exit Codes: Validate success via configurable return codes Provider Interface Exec providers must implement the ExecProvider interface:</description></item><item><title>File Type</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/file/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/file/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the design of the file resource type for managing files and directories.
Overview The file resource manages files and directories with three aspects:
Existence: Whether the file/directory exists or is absent Content: The contents of a file (from inline content or source file) Attributes: Owner, group, and permissions Provider Interface File providers must implement the FileProvider interface:</description></item><item><title>Package Type</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/package/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/package/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the design of the package resource type for managing software packages.
Overview The package resource manages software packages with two aspects:
Existence: Whether the package is installed or absent Version: The specific version installed (when applicable) Provider Interface Package providers must implement the PackageProvider interface:</description></item><item><title>Service Type</title><link>https://choria-cm.dev/design/service/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-cm.dev/design/service/index.html</guid><description>This document describes the design of the service resource type for managing system services.
Overview The service resource manages system services with two independent dimensions:
Running state: Whether the service is currently running or stopped Enabled state: Whether the service starts automatically at boot These are managed independently, allowing combinations like “running but disabled” or “stopped but enabled”.</description></item></channel></rss>
