For this reason I wrote extlookup and hiera years ago for the Puppet community. Despite the minimal focus of this tool we still need data to vary the behaviour.
Data can be used for:
Configuring resource names that differ between Operating Systems like httpd vs apache2 package names Set different configuration values depending on environment, role or other dimensions Decide if some environments shold have something installed and others not - like development vs production environments Choria CM supports various data sources:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/data/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
