For example, you might not want to manage your dotfiles automatically (allowing for local modifications), but you do want to keep Docker up to date.
The CCM Agent runs manifests continuously, loading them from local files, Object Storage, or HTTP(S) URLs, with Key-Value data overlaid.
In time, the Agent will become a key part of a service registry system, allowing for continuous monitoring of managed resources and sharing that state into a registry—enabling other nodes to use file resources to create configurations that combine knowledge of all nodes.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://choria-cm.dev/agent/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
