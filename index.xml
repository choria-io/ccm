This makes them complex to use and with a lot of dependencies.
Systems like Puppet do not really do well with Application management - they focus on on systems management.
Choria has Autonomous Agents that can be used for application lifecycle management but thus far lacked any kind of Configuration Management.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/resources/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/resources/index.html</guid><description>A resource is how you describe the desired state of your infrastructure. They represent a thing you want to manage and they are backed by providers which implement the actual management for your Operating System.
Each resource has a type and a unique name followed by some resource-specific properties.
Package When you manage a package, you describe the stable state you desire. Should the package merely be present, or the latest version, or a specific version?</description></item><item><title>Data</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/data/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/data/index.html</guid><description>Just like applications need data to vary their behavior and configure their environments, so do Configuration Management tools.
For this reason I wrote extlookup and hiera years ago for the Puppet community. Despite the minimal focus of this tool we still need data to vary the behaviour.
Data can be used for:
Configuring resource names that differ between Operating Systems like httpd vs apache2 package names Set different configuration values depending on environment, role or other dimensions Decide if some environments shold have something installed and others not - like development vs production environments Choria CM supports various data sources:</description></item><item><title>CLI Usage</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/cli/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/cli/index.html</guid><description>We are designing CCM to be used as a CLI tool as its first class method of interaction.
Each resource type has its own subcommand under ccm ensure that maps to the resource type, with required inputs being arguments and optionals being flags.
The CLI commands are designed to be idempotent; this means that they can be used to write shell scripts that can safely be run multiple times.
Managing a single resource Managing a single resource is really easy, however, some features will not function without preparing a session.</description></item><item><title>YAML Manifests</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/yamlmanifests/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/ccm/yamlmanifests/index.html</guid><description>A manifest is a YAML file that combines data, platform-specific configuration and resources all in one file.
There is no logic - other than what expressions can do, consider it to be no more complex than basic example multi-resource shell scripts.
The YAML file resolves the manifest using Choria Hierarchical Data Resolver, our single-file implementation of Hiera.
Full Example Input Data First, we define input data, think of this like the properties a module accepts:</description></item></channel></rss>
