# Choria Configuration Manager


> CCM is a small-scale Configuration Management system designed to meet users where they are - enabling experimentation, R&D, and exploration without the overhead of full-system management while still following sound Configuration Management principles. We focus on great UX, immediate feedback, and interactive use with minimal friction.
